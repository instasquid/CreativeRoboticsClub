# CreativeRoboticsClub

The Creative Robotics Club was started in 2024 at UNSW Art, Design and Architecture, Paddington NSW.

It's goal is to teach designers, artists, and the non-technical, skills to make electronic projects without overburdening them with technical information. Thus the information in these slides is not comprehensive and sometimess glosses over important concepts in favour of making things fun.

This repository exists to hold the sildes from each session, making it easier for present club members to review and new club members to see what we're up to.
